This was created as a little "Fun with CTEs" experiment. More importantly, we'll figure out how much each customer has spent on their average order.

CustomerID with a respective *average* order total, i.e.,
the average amount that a particular customer has spent per order.

CustomerID number 4 has the lowest average total while 2 has the highest.

  Looks like Park and Shop Convenience Stores spends the most -- over twice the amount Tres Delicious does.
  It succeeds ABC Groceries by about $2500. Meanwhile, ABC Groceries overtakes ACME Bites by less than $200.
  This difference clearly deviates from the others, which range in the thousands at smallest.
